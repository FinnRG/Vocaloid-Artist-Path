# Vocaloid-Artist-Path

The Vocaloid community is known to have a high degree of connectedness. Through the [Vocaloid Artist Path Finder](https://pyther99.github.io/Vocaloid-Artist-Path/), this collaborativeness can be experienced using data from [VocaDB](https://vocadb.net/).

## How it works

The website accepts a VocaDB Artist ID and name as input.
From the collected data, artist collaborations were extracted and summarized in a graph, The Vocaloid Artist path Finder uses [Bidirectional Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_search) to find paths in this network.
